# Welcome to PhenoCount!

PhenoCount, short for Phenomena Counter, is a mobile application that allows for crowdsourcing of phenomena. 

With the intent to inspire others to get involved in research and scientific observation, we designed an easy to learn, user friendly layout application that provides the basic tools for publishing an experiment. 

Our goal is to provide a convenient and streamlined process for anyone to contribute to other experiments, and receive data for their own experiments. 

The application is targeted for younger or casual users, and is not intended to support a tenured researcher at a post-secondary institution. 

We are confident our application will encourage others to get involved in science and develop a critical thinking mindset. PhenoCount opens up a whole new world in your hands and will allow you to create, connect, and converse with others on phenomena happening across the globe.
